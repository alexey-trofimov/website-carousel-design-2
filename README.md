## Minimal and Simple Website Carousel

*Powered by Tiny Slider 2*

This is a simple and responsive carousel for your website with a minimal design. This carousel is powered by **Tiny Slider 2** - a JavaScript library for creating sliders and carousels.

A **demo** of the carousel is available here: [Carousel Demo](https://demo.minimalweb.net/website-carousel-design-2/). Demonstration in **Cyrillic** (**Russian** language): [Demo in Russian](https://demo.minimalweb.net/website-carousel-design-2/russian-language.html).

### Some notes:

*Image sizes:* I'm using **1920px by 1280 px** images in the carousel demo.

*Google fonts:* [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) (400, 500, 500 Italic, 700, 800).

I also use the "**mw-**" prefix for CSS classes and IDs. This should make it easier to use this carousel if you want to add it to your project, since using this prefix will reduce the chance of conflicts with your project's styles.

### Thanks so much:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
